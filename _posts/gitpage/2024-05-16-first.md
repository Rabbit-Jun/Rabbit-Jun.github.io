# How to Merge Different Branches
Firstly, before merging, you need to commit your changes using Git.  
If you haven't committed, you'll face an error message prompting you to make a commit.  

Secondly, once you've committed your changes, switch to the branch you want to integrate with another branch by typing `git checkout <your_branch_name>`in the terminal.  
This command lets you switch to the desired branch.  


Thirdly, to merge another branch into your current branch, use the command `git merge <branch_with_changes_you_want_to_include>`.  


Additionally, I encountered an error related to ownership because I was using WSL.  
To resolve it, I used the command `sudo chown -R $(whoami) <path>`.  
<hr>

![ownersip error](/assets/gitimg/ownership_er.png)  
<hr>
Here, sudo stands for "superuser do," chown means "change ownership," and -R stands for "recursive."  
This command tells the computer to change the ownership of the directory recursively to the current user (whoami).  

However, the same error occurred again, so I used a workaround: `git config --global add safe.directory <your_path>`.  
This command is not generally recommended, but I was short on time. T^T

ah!!  
If your local content is the final version and you don't mind if the Git save content changes, you can do `git push --force <your repository>`.  
However, if you have a team, please do this after sufficient discussion.
